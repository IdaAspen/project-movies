# Project Movies

This project was about building a multi-page React application, and using API. This was a pair programming project made by Anna Thunberg & Ida Aspen

## Features

- To build multi-page applications using React Router.
- To pass information such as product ids, or blog post titles in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content.
- Practice using APIs in React combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## The problem

- We decided to go with a specific actors movie list to be able to train more on API. However this specific list was not sorted so our main issue was to sorter the list after release_date
